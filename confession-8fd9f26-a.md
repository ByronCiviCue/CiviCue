# Pre-flight Checklist & Confession — Step 3.4 (Atomic A)

1) Scope Compliance: **Yes** — Only analyzed `.js` specifiers and type-only imports under `src/**`; no changes required.
2) Aspirational Code: **No** — No refactors or "nice-to-haves" introduced.
3) Atomic Changes: **Yes** — This step is analysis/verification only; zero file modifications.
4) Pushback: None — ESM compliance already satisfied; idempotent reruns produce no diff.
5) Protocol Deviations: **No** — Followed exclusions and verification commands as specified.

**Modified files:** _None_
**Defense Statement:** The codebase already complies with NodeNext ESM requirements for relative specifiers and type-only imports. This atomic step is a verified no-op.
