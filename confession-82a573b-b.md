# Pre-flight Checklist & Confession — Step 3.4 (Atomic B)

1) **Scope Compliance**: **Yes** — Only analyzed CommonJS patterns under `src/**`; no changes required.

2) **Files Modified**: 
   - _None_

3) **Risk Notes**: 
   - No dynamic imports added
   - No JSON imports with assertions added
   - No __dirname/__filename conversions required

4) **Idempotency Proof**: 
   - Initial scan found zero CommonJS patterns in scope
   - Verification confirms no CommonJS remains
   - Running again would yield identical no-op result

5) **Follow-ups**: 
   - None required; codebase already fully ESM-compliant for CommonJS patterns

**Defense Statement:** The codebase already eliminated all CommonJS patterns. This atomic step verified zero residual `require()`, `module.exports`, `exports.x`, `__dirname`, or `__filename` usage exists in `src/**`. The ESM migration for CommonJS elimination was previously completed.
