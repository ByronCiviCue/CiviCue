# Pre-flight Checklist & Confession - Task 7.5 Lint Fix

## What Changed
- Removed unused `path` import from scripts/validate-datasf-index.mjs to satisfy ESLint no-unused-vars

## Why Safe
- No runtime usage of `path` found in validator code
- Validator behavior unchanged - all logic intact
- Only import line removed, no functional code modified

## Gates Run
- pnpm -s lint: ✅ green (no-unused-vars satisfied)
- pnpm -s typecheck: ✅ green (no type issues)  
- pnpm -s test: ✅ green (17/17 tests passed)

## Scope Control
- No additional edits beyond removing unused import
- No eslint-disable lines added
- No changes to CI, package.json, or other files
- Validator contract and exit codes unchanged
