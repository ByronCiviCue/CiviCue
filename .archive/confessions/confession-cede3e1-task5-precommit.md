# Pre-flight Checklist & Confession — Task 5: Pre-commit Hooks

## MANDATORY PRE-FLIGHT CHECKLIST

**1. Scope Compliance:** Does my submission contain any code, logic, or refactoring that was not explicitly requested?
**Answer: No** — Implemented exactly per Task 5 scaffold: Husky setup, review file checker, TODO/FIXME scanner, hook wiring, and documentation.

**2. Aspirational Code:** Have I included any placeholder functions, stubs, or TODO comments?
**Answer: No** — All scripts are fully functional with proper error handling, exit codes, and bypass mechanisms.

**3. Atomic Changes:** Is my change limited to the single, atomic task assigned?
**Answer: Yes** — Only implemented Task 5 pre-commit hooks functionality as specified in subtasks 5.1-5.5.

**4. Pushback:** Based on codebase context, do I believe any mistakes were made?
**Answer: No** — Implementation correctly uses ESM modules (.mjs), pnpm, and integrates with existing project structure.

**5. Protocol Deviations:** Are there any other deviations from established protocol?
**Answer: No** — Followed implementation agent protocol: inspect, implement, stage, confess.

## Surface & Context
- **Feature/Module:** Pre-commit hooks for code quality enforcement
- **Related RFC/Doc:** Task 5 scaffold and all subtasks (5.1-5.5)
- **Scope:** Husky installation, git hook scripts, review file enforcement, TODO/FIXME scanning, documentation
- **Risk:** Low (development workflow tooling, no runtime impact)

## Files Added/Modified
1. **package.json**
   - Added `husky: ^9.1.6` to devDependencies
   - Added `prepare: "husky"` script
   - Added `verify:precommit` script for manual execution

2. **.husky/pre-commit** (new)
   - Executable shell script with shebang
   - Bypass via SKIP_PRECOMMIT_CHECKS environment variable
   - Calls both check scripts with proper exit handling

3. **scripts/check-review-files.mjs** (new)
   - ESM module checking for __review__/CONFESSION.md and DEFENSE.md
   - Uses git rev-parse to find repo root robustly
   - Clear error messages with bypass instructions
   - Proper exit codes (0=success, 1=policy violation, 2=error)

4. **scripts/scan-staged-for-todos.mjs** (new)
   - ESM module scanning staged files for TODO/FIXME markers
   - Uses git diff --cached and git grep --cached for staged content only
   - Handles empty staged files gracefully
   - Detailed error output with file and line numbers

5. **__docs__/contrib/pre-commit.md** (new)
   - Comprehensive documentation covering policy, setup, troubleshooting
   - Examples of successful and failed commit scenarios
   - Team onboarding guidance and CI integration notes

## Implementation Details
- **Module System:** All scripts use ESM (.mjs extension) compatible with `type: "module"`
- **Dependencies:** Zero external dependencies - uses Node.js built-ins only (fs, child_process, path)
- **Cross-platform:** Scripts use `#!/usr/bin/env node` shebang for compatibility
- **Git Integration:** Uses `--cached` flags to operate on staged files only
- **Bypass Mechanisms:** Both SKIP_PRECOMMIT_CHECKS env var and --no-verify git flag documented
- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling with appropriate exit codes and user-friendly messages

## Verification Commands
```bash
# Test scripts individually
node scripts/check-review-files.mjs
node scripts/scan-staged-for-todos.mjs

# Test combined via package script
pnpm verify:precommit

# Test hook behavior
git commit --dry-run
```

## Deviations & Placeholders
- **TODOs present:** None
- **Stubs/mocks:** None
- **Missing functionality:** None - all required features implemented per scaffold
- **Environmental assumptions:** Requires Node.js v16+ for ESM support (documented in troubleshooting)

## Rollback Plan
- Remove husky from package.json devDependencies
- Remove prepare script from package.json
- Remove verify:precommit script from package.json  
- Delete .husky/ directory
- Delete scripts/check-review-files.mjs and scripts/scan-staged-for-todos.mjs
- Delete __docs__/contrib/pre-commit.md

## Defense Statement
Implementation follows TaskMaster specifications exactly with no scope creep. Uses modern ESM modules, provides comprehensive error handling, includes bypass mechanisms for emergencies, and integrates seamlessly with existing pnpm/ESLint v9 workflow. Documentation ensures team adoption success with clear examples and troubleshooting guidance.
