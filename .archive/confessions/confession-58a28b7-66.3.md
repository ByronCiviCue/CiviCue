# Pre-flight Checklist & Confession

## Deviations & Placeholders
- TODOs present: none
- Stubs/mocks: none
- Missing tests: none  
- Unvalidated env reads: none
- Rate-limit/backoff gaps: none
- OpenAPI mismatch: none
- Performance landmines: none

## Surface & Context
Feature/Module: Socrata catalog ingestion service error handling and recovery strategies (Task 66.3)
Related RFC/Doc: none
Scope: services/discovery/socrataCatalogIngest.ts, src/types/ingest.ts, tests/services/socrataCatalogIngest.spec.ts
Risk: low (isolated retry logic with comprehensive test coverage)

## Invariants Claimed  
- OpenAPI conformance: n/a (internal service, no API endpoints)
- I/O timeouts: uses existing socrata http client with timeout/retry
- Retries/backoff: exponential backoff with jitter, configurable (3 attempts, 1-30s delays)
- Pagination: existing cursor-based pagination preserved
- Tests added: 10 test scenarios including error classification, retry exhaustion, fatal errors
- correlationId logs end-to-end: yes via structured logging with snake_case keys

## Quick Test Plan
```bash
pnpm -s typecheck  # ✓ passed
pnpm -s lint       # ✓ passed  
pnpm test -- tests/services/socrataCatalogIngest.spec.ts  # ✓ 10/10 passed
```

## Rollback
Task enhances existing service with backward-compatible retry configuration. Rollback: remove retryConfig from options type and revert to direct iterator usage.
