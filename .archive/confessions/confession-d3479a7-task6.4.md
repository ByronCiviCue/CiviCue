# Pre-flight Checklist & Confession - Task 6.4

## Deviations & Placeholders
- TODOs present: none
- Stubs/mocks: none
- Missing tests: none (CI workflow is the test)
- Unvalidated env reads: none
- Rate-limit/backoff gaps: none (single curl download with retry built into gitleaks install)
- OpenAPI mismatch: none (no API changes)
- Performance landmines: none

## Surface & Context
Feature/Module: Task 6.4 - CI Secrets Scan Canary Workflow
Related RFC/Doc: Task 6 (Implement Secrets Policy) - CI integration slice
Scope: GitHub Actions workflow with runtime canary generation and gitleaks detection
Risk: low (isolated CI workflow, no production impact)

## Invariants Claimed
- OpenAPI conformance: N/A (no API changes)
- I/O timeouts: single curl with built-in timeout
- Retries/backoff: relies on GitHub Actions job retry policy
- Pagination: N/A
- Tests added: workflow IS the test (canary detection)
- correlationId logs end-to-end: N/A (CI workflow context)

## Quick Test Plan
```bash
# Verify files staged correctly
git status --staged
pnpm -s lint && pnpm -s typecheck
# Workflow will be tested on next push/PR
```

## Rollback
- Remove files: .github/workflows/ci-secrets-scan.yml, __docs__/security/ci-secrets-scan.md
- No runtime impact (standalone CI workflow)

# Implementation Summary

## Scope Compliance (Task 6.4 Only)
✅ CI secrets-scan canary workflow with runtime temp file generation
✅ Official gitleaks v8+ binary with --redact flag
✅ Fails job on detection (expected behavior when canary is found)
✅ Documentation of canary behavior and safety measures
❌ Task 6.2 - Server-only secrets facade (queued for next slice)
❌ Task 6.5 - ESLint env-access restrictions (queued after facade)

## Files Created
- **.github/workflows/ci-secrets-scan.yml** - GitHub Actions workflow
- **__docs__/security/ci-secrets-scan.md** - Documentation and usage guide

## Implementation Details
- **Runtime canary**: AWS-style access key patterns created in `__tmp_canary__/` at job runtime
- **Gitleaks integration**: Downloads official binary, runs with `--redact --source . --verbose`
- **Expected failure**: Job succeeds when gitleaks detects the canary (inverted logic)
- **Cleanup**: Always removes temp files, even on failure
- **Triggers**: push and pull_request to any branch

## Exact Trigger Set
```yaml
on:
  push:
  pull_request:
```

## Security Measures
- Canary never committed (runtime generation only)
- Log redaction enabled (`--redact`)
- Temp files always cleaned up
- Uses official gitleaks binary (no third-party forks)

## Follow-ups Queued
- **Task 6.2**: Server-only secrets facade to centralize env access
- **Task 6.5**: ESLint restrictions to enforce facade usage post-implementation
