# Pre-flight Checklist & Confession

## Deviations & Placeholders
- TODOs present: none
- Stubs/mocks: none (comprehensive mocking in tests)
- Missing tests: none
- Unvalidated env reads: none
- Rate-limit/backoff gaps: none (inherits from 66.3 retry logic)
- OpenAPI mismatch: n/a (internal service, no API endpoints)
- Performance landmines: none (batched transactions with configurable size)

## Surface & Context
Feature/Module: Durable resume and idempotent writes for Socrata catalog ingest (Task 66.4)
Related RFC/Doc: __docs__/services/socrata-catalog-ingest.md (updated with resume section)
Scope: services/discovery/socrataCatalogIngest.ts, src/db/catalog/repo.ts, src/db/catalog/types.ts, src/db/kysely.ts, src/types/ingest.ts, tests/services/socrataCatalogIngest.spec.ts, db/migrations/0012_catalog_resume_state.sql
Risk: medium (database transactions with state management, but comprehensive test coverage)

## Invariants Claimed
- OpenAPI conformance: n/a (internal service)
- I/O timeouts: inherits existing Kysely/pg timeout settings
- Retries/backoff: inherits from 66.3 exponential backoff implementation
- Pagination: existing cursor-based pagination preserved with durable resume
- Tests added: 8 new test scenarios for durable resume, batch processing, idempotency, failure recovery
- correlationId logs end-to-end: yes via structured logging with snake_case keys

## Quick Test Plan
```bash
pnpm -s typecheck  # ✓ passed
pnpm -s lint       # ✓ passed (fixed cognitive complexity + duplicate strings)
pnpm test -- tests/services/socrataCatalogIngest.spec.ts  # ✓ 18/18 tests passed (10 original + 8 new)
```

## Rollback
Task adds new optional configuration (`batchSize`, `resumeEnabled`) with backward compatibility. Rollback: 
1. Set `resumeEnabled: false` in configuration to disable resume functionality
2. Revert to pre-66.4 behavior without database state persistence
3. Drop `catalog.resume_state` table if needed: `DROP TABLE catalog.resume_state;`
