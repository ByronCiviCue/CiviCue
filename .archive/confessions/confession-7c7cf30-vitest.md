# Pre-flight Checklist & Confession — Vitest projects repair

1) **Scope Compliance**: **Yes** — Only edited `vitest.config.ts` and `package.json` scripts as specified.

2) **Files Modified**:
   - `vitest.config.ts` — Fixed project configuration by moving `projects` array inside `test` object with correct structure
   - `package.json` — Scripts already use `--project` flag correctly (no changes needed from previous update)

3) **Root Cause**:
   - Vitest 3.x requires `test.projects` (not root-level `projects`)
   - Each project needs `test.name` property inside the `test` object, not at project root level
   - Previous configuration had incorrect nesting structure

4) **Risks/Assumptions**:
   - `contracts` and `integration` suites are empty by design; `--passWithNoTests` prevents CI failures
   - `arch` suite successfully runs `tests/eslint-*.test.ts`
   - `unit` suite correctly excludes arch tests and runs general tests

5) **Idempotency**:
   - Re-running yields identical files; configuration is deterministic
   - All project names are unique as required by Vitest

**Defense Statement:** Fixed Vitest 3.x project configuration to use correct `test.projects` structure, enabling `--project` flag to properly filter test suites. CI and local runs now execute with proper test segregation and no "No projects matched" errors.
