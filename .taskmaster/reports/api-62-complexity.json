			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Task 62 is already 90% implemented with comprehensive Socrata adapters, clients, codecs, and test infrastructure. Focus remaining work on: 1) Final cleanup of remaining LLM scaffolding comments from regions.ts and discoveryClient.ts, 2) Add comprehensive JSDoc documentation to all exported APIs, 3) CLI tools finalization and verification scripts. The core dataset functionality, v2/v3 clients, SoQL builder, type codecs, regional routing, and test infrastructure are all complete and tested.",
			"reasoning": "Analysis shows Task 62 is nearly complete with ~1000 lines of production code already implemented. Core components like row client (74 lines), metadata fetching (105 lines), SoQL builder (179 lines), codecs (174 lines), v3 client (82 lines), and regions (110 lines) are done. Test infrastructure with cassettes exists. Only minor cleanup tasks remain: removing LLM comments and adding JSDoc. This is primarily documentation/polish work, not new development."
