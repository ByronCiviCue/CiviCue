			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "v2 dataset row client",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for: 1. Creating a basic HTTP client wrapper for Socrata v2 endpoints using an existing fetch implementation. 2. Implementing the offset/limit pagination loop to fetch all rows for a given query. 3. Integrating the `X-App-Token` header using the existing environment configuration resolver. 4. Adding retry logic with exponential backoff for 429 and 5xx errors, respecting `Retry-After` headers. 5. Implementing a configurable request throttler to manage rate limits.",
			"reasoning": "This is a foundational task requiring greenfield development of a resilient network client. Codebase analysis shows basic env var handling exists but no advanced HTTP client with pagination, retries, or throttling. These are distinct, complex features that should be built and tested sequentially, making the overall complexity high."

			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Column metadata & type map",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for: 1. Building a function to fetch raw metadata from the `/api/views/<id>.json` endpoint using the client from subtask 62.1. 2. Creating a parser that processes the raw JSON response and extracts the `columns` array. 3. Implementing the normalization logic to map Socrata `dataTypeName` values to a standardized internal `TypeMap` interface, including all geospatial types. 4. Adding a simple in-memory cache (e.g., a `Map`) to store and retrieve metadata by dataset ID to avoid redundant API calls.",
			"reasoning": "While fetching is straightforward using the client from 62.1, the core complexity is in data modeling and transformation. Creating a robust, normalized mapping for all Socrata types, including complex ones, is a detailed and non-trivial task. Caching adds a state management component. This is mostly greenfield work as no such type mapping exists."

			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "SoQL builder (typed DSL)",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for: 1. Scaffolding the main SoQL builder class with a fluent API and basic methods like `limit()` and `offset()`. 2. Implementing the `select()` method to handle column selection and aliasing. 3. Building the `where()` method with support for common operators and type-aware, injection-safe parameterization. 4. Adding `orderBy()` and `groupBy()` methods. 5. Implementing support for advanced SoQL functions, starting with one geospatial function (e.g., `within_circle`) and one date function (e.g., `date_trunc_ymd`).",
			"reasoning": "Building a fluent, type-safe DSL is a significant software design challenge. Codebase analysis and task context (Task 11) indicate this is a new, more robust implementation. The complexity is high due to the need for a well-designed API, prevention of SoQL injection, and support for numerous clauses and functions, especially type-aware ones."

			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Type codecs (incl. geo)",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for: 1. Defining the core `Codec` interface and a registry to hold codec implementations. 2. Implementing codecs for primitive types like text, number, and boolean. 3. Implementing codecs for temporal types (e.g., `fixed_timestamp`), ensuring correct parsing of ISO 8601 strings and timezone handling. 4. Implementing codecs for geospatial types, focusing on `point` and `polygon` with WKT/GeoJSON output. 5. Creating a dispatcher function that takes a `TypeMap` and a raw data row and returns a fully parsed, typed object.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves low-level, detail-oriented work that is prone to edge cases. Codebase analysis shows no existing data-type parsers. The complexity is high due to the sheer number of Socrata types and the inherent difficulty of correctly handling temporal and geospatial data formats (WKT/GeoJSON), which requires significant testing and validation."

			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "v3 POST query support + Basic auth",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for: 1. Implementing a secure Basic Authentication header generator that reads `key_id` and `secret` from environment variables. 2. Creating a new HTTP client function for the v3 POST query endpoint, constructing the required JSON body. 3. Implementing the v3-style pagination loop using `pageNumber` and `pageSize`. 4. Adding configuration-based logic to select between the v2 and v3 clients for a given request, including a graceful fallback mechanism.",
			"reasoning": "This task is complex as it introduces a new API version, a different authentication method, and a new pagination model. Codebase analysis confirms this is entirely new functionality. Securely handling credentials, which must never be logged, and implementing the fallback logic between v2 and v3 adds significant risk and complexity."

			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Test rig (record/replay)",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for: 1. Evaluating and choosing an HTTP mocking/recording library (e.g., `nock`, `polly.js`) and integrating it into the project's test setup. 2. Configuring the library to save and load fixtures ('cassettes') from a dedicated directory with a consistent naming scheme. 3. Creating helper functions or test setup hooks to easily enable record/replay mode for integration tests. 4. Converting one new integration test (e.g., for the v2 client) to use the record/replay system, ensuring it passes in CI without live network calls.",
			"reasoning": "This is a foundational task for improving test reliability and speed. While libraries exist, the complexity lies in the greenfield setup: integrating the tool with the existing test runner and HTTP client, establishing fixture management patterns, and ensuring it's easy for developers to use. This is moderately complex infrastructure work."

			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Regional endpoint routing",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for: 1. Creating a configuration map and a resolver function that returns the correct Socrata API base URL (e.g., `api.us.socrata.com`) based on a given dataset domain and environment variables. 2. Integrating this resolver function into the core HTTP client to prefix all API calls with the correct regional endpoint. 3. Writing unit tests to confirm the routing logic works for default cases, domain-specific rules, and environment variable overrides.",
			"reasoning": "This is a low-to-medium complexity task. The implementation itself is likely a small amount of code (e.g., a lookup map). However, it modifies a critical part of the networking layer, requiring careful integration and thorough testing. Codebase analysis shows no existing regional logic, so it's a new feature, but it's self-contained."
