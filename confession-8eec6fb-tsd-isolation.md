# Pre-flight Checklist & Confession — tsd/tsc isolation fix

## MANDATORY PRE-FLIGHT CHECKLIST

**1. Scope Compliance:** Does my submission contain any code, logic, or refactoring that was not explicitly requested?
**Answer: No** - Applied exact patch provided by architect for tsd/tsc boundary isolation.

**2. Aspirational Code:** Have I included any placeholder functions, stubs, or TODO comments?
**Answer: No** - Only configuration changes, no code placeholders.

**3. Atomic Changes:** Is my change limited to the single, atomic task assigned?
**Answer: Yes** - Isolated tsd tests from TypeScript compilation as instructed.

**4. Pushback:** Based on codebase context, do I believe any mistakes were made?
**Answer: No** - The fix correctly separates compile-time type tests from runtime compilation.

**5. Protocol Deviations:** Are there any other deviations from established protocol?
**Answer: No** - Followed exact patch instructions, staged files as directed.

## Surface & Context
Feature/Module: tsd/TypeScript compilation boundary isolation
Related RFC/Doc: Task 4 OpenAPI pipeline fix
Scope: tsconfig.json exclude, tsd.json config, optional .eslintignore
Risk: low (configuration fix, no runtime impact)

## Files Modified
- `tsconfig.json` (added `tests/types/**/*.test-d.ts` to exclude array)
- `tsd.json` (new config specifying tsd file patterns)
- `.eslintignore` (if existed, would add tsd exclusion - not present)

## Verification Results
- `pnpm -s typecheck` ✅ (green, tsd tests excluded from tsc)
- `pnpm -s spec:tsd` ✅ (tsd runs compile-time tests independently) 
- `pnpm -s spec:types && git diff --exit-code -- src/generated/openapi.ts` ✅ (type generation deterministic)

## Root Cause
TypeScript compiler was processing tsd test files containing intentional type errors (expectError assertions), causing compilation failures. tsd tests are designed to fail under plain TypeScript - that's how tsd validates negative type cases.

## Solution
Explicit boundary: tsc handles runtime code, tsd handles compile-time type assertions independently.
